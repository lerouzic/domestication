\opening{Dear editors, }

Attached you will find the final version for our manuscript \emph{Gene network simulations provide testable predictions for the
molecular domestication syndrome}, which previous version (GENETICS-2021-304784) has been accepted pending minor changes (typos). 

We enjoyed very much the stimulating scientific discussion with the editorial board and the reviewers, who were all professional and accurate with their criticisms of the previous versions of the manuscript. Addressing their comments was challenging, and we are sorry we had to make desicisons about what to include or not in the manuscript among the reviewers' suggestions, which were all relevant. 

\closing{On behalf of all co-authors, yours sincerely,}

\end{letter}
